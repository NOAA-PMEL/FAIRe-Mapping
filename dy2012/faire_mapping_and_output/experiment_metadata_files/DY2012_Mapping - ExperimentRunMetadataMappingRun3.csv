Sample information,samp_name,"Sample Name is a name that you choose for the sample. It can have any format, but we suggest that you make it concise, unique and consistent within your lab, and as informative as possible. Every Sample Name from a single Submitter must be unique.",Mandatory,,free text,,,,S01,exact,SampleName,
PCR,assay_name,"A brief, concise identifier for assay with no spaces or special characters, ensuring machine readability. This ID will be used in file names as 'assay_name'.",Mandatory,,free text,,,,MiFish (metabarcoding) / eSERU5 (qPCR),related,Metabarcoding Marker,Need to match and transform to standardized assay name
PCR,pcr_plate_id,"PCR plate ID. This identifier is particularly crucial when location-specific standard curves are employed for targeted assay detections, as it ensures a linkage between the standards and the corresponding eDNA samples.
