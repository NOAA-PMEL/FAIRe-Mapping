"Project","assay_type","The method used in the eDNA study to detect taxon/taxa of interest in environmental sample. A targeted eDNA assay is designed to detect the presence of a specific species or a small subset of taxa (such as a genus or family) using techniques like quantitative PCR (qPCR). This contrasts with a metabarcoding eDNA assay which aims to characterize the composition of broader taxonomic communities, often encompassing multiple phyletic groups, by utilising high-throughput sequencing such as metabarcoding","Mandatory","controlled vocabulary","","","targeted | metabarcoding | other:","targeted","metabarcoding","2025-07-30"
